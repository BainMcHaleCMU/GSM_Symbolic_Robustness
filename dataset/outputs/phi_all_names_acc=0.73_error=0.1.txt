She teaches 5 classes on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday.\nSo, the total number of classes in a week = (5 classes/day * 5 days/week) + 8 classes = 25 + 8 = <<(5*5)+8=33>>33 classes.\nNext, calculate the total number of students Zoey teaches in a week. Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students = 33 classes * 15 students/class = <<33*15=495>>495 students.\nFinally, calculate the total amount of money Zoey makes in a week. She charges ₩15.00 per student, so the total amount = 495 students * ₩15.00/student = ₩7425.00.\nThe number of classes Zoey teaches on weekdays or Saturday doesn't affect the total amount she makes, so it is ignored.\n#### 7425\n\n", tensor(6): "40% of the way through the download is 200 * .4 = <<200*.4=80>>80 GB\nLevi can download 2 GB/minute, so it takes 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes to download the first 80 GB.\nThe restart to install updates takes 20 minutes.\nLevi has to restart the download from the beginning, so it takes another 40 minutes to download the first 80 GB.\nThe total time to download the file is 40 + 20 + 40 = <<40+20+40=100>>100 minutes.\nThe updates installed during the download don't affect the download time, so they are ignored.\n#### 100\n\n", tensor(64): "\nFirst, calculate the amount of food needed for the first 180 days: 1 cup/day * 180 days = <<1*180=180>>180 cups\nThen, calculate the amount of food needed for the rest of the year: 2 cups/day * (365 days - 180 days) = 2 cups/day * 185 days = <<2*185=370>>370 cups\nNow, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of food needed in the first year: 180 cups + 370 cups = <<180+370=550>>550 cups\nFinally, divide the total amount of food needed by the amount of food in one bag to find the number of bags needed: 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = <<550/110=5>>5 bags\nThe puppy's age or the rest of its life doesn't affect the amount of food needed in the first year, so they are ignored.\n####", tensor(45): '\nFirst, find the number of dozens of eggs produced per day: 252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = <<252/12=21>>21 dozens\nThen find the amount of money made per day: 21 dozens * ₩2 per dozen = ₩42\nThen find the amount of money made per week: ₩42 per day * 7 days per week = ₩294\nThe amount of money made per week is ₩294.\n#### 294\n\n'}
