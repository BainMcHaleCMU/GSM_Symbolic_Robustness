Q: James replaces the coffee for the household. There are 3 other people in the house, and everyone drinks 2 cups of coffee a day. It takes 0.5 ounces of coffee per cup of coffee. If coffee costs $1.25 an ounce, how much does he spend on coffee a week, assuming he also bought 3 new t-shirts last month for $15 each?
A: Let's think step by step. There are 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 people in the house
So they drink 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 cups of coffee a day
That means they use 8*.5=<<8*.5=4>>4 ounces of coffee a day
So they use 4*7=<<4*7=28>>28 ounces of coffee a week
So he spends 28*1.25=$<<28*1.25=35>>35
The cost of the t-shirts does not affect how much he spends on coffee, so it is ignored.

Q: The city’s bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day. How many people does the bus system carry for 13 weeks, assuming that during this time, 5% of passengers used discounted tickets and 2% used monthly passes?
A: Let's think step by step. 13 weeks have 13 * 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 days.
For 91 days the bus system carries 1,200,000 * 91 = <<1200000*91=109200000>>109,200,000 people.
The choice to use discounted tickets or monthly passes is irrelevant, so it is ignored.

Q: A highway is being extended from its current length of 200 miles up to 650 miles. 50 miles are built on the first day, and three times this amount are built on the second day. How many miles still need to be added to the highway to finish extending it, given that half the construction team plans to be on break at least 10% of tomorrow?
A: Let's think step by step. The length of the highway that needs to be constructed is 650 – 200 = <<650-200=450>>450 miles.
After the first day, there are still 450 – 50 = <<450-50=400>>400 miles that need to be constructed.
On the second day, 50 miles * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 miles are added to the highway.
This means that 400 – 150 = <<400-150=250>>250 miles still need to be added to the highway.
How much break the construction team takes does not affect the amount needed to to be added, so it is ignored.

Q: The town’s annual budget totals $32 million. If half of the budget goes towards policing and $12 million goes towards education, how much money is left for managing public spaces, assuming the cost of managing public spaces increased by $2 million compared to last year?
A: Let's think step by step. The annual budget for policing is 32 / 2 = $<<32/2=16>>16 million.
The combined budget for education and policing is 16 + 12 = $<<16+12=28>>28 million.
There is 32 - 28 = $<<32-28=4>>4 million to manage public spaces.
The increase from last year does not affect the calculation for this year, so it is ignored.

Q: Sasha heard that planting trees helps to reduce the local temperature. For each tree planted, the temperature drops 0.1 degrees. A tree costs $6 to plant. If she got the local temperature to drop from 80 to 78.2, how much did it cost to plant the trees, considering that 10% of the trees were planted in shaded areas where they are expected to grow twice as tall?
A: Let's think step by step. The temperature dropped 1.8 degrees because 80 -78.2 = <<80-78.2=1.8>>1.8
She planted 18 trees because 1.8 / .1 = <<1.8/.1=18>>18
It cost $108 to plant the trees because 18 x 6 = <<18*6=108>>108
The location of where the trees were planted does not affect cost, so it is ignored.

Q: Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entrée, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose, assuming the dinner theater was expected to serve a three-course meal costing $25 per person?
A: Let's think step by step. First find the cost of the ticket and the entrée for each person: $50/person + $10/person = $<<50+10=60>>60/person
Then multiply that cost by the number of people to find the total cost of entrees and tickets: $60/person * 6 people = $<<60*6=360>>360
Now find how many people ordered drink tickets: 6 people / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 people
Now find the total cost of the drink tickets: 3 people * $30/person = $<<3*30=90>>90
Now find the total cost of the evening: $90 + $360 = $<<90+360=450>>450
Now multiply this quantity by 90% to find the amount of the refund: $450 * .9 = $<<450*.9=405>>405
Now subtract the refund amount from the total cost to find how much money the friends lost: $450 - $405 = $<<450-405=45>>45
The expected cost of the meal was never payed and doesn't affect the lost cost, so it is ignored.

Q: The marching band has 110 members. There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind, and twice as many woodwinds as brass. How many brass players are there, if 10 members of the band are also part of the school orchestra?
A: Let's think step by step. Let x represent the number of brass players in the band
Woodwind:2x
Percussion:4(2x)=8x
Total:x+2x+8x=110
11x=110
x=<<10=10>>10
The number of students also in orchestra doesn't matter, so it is ignored.

Q: The Indigo Restaurant receives 18 online customer reviews. They receive six 5-star reviews, seven 4-star reviews, four 3-star reviews, and one 2-star review. What is the average star rating for Indigo Restaurant based on these reviews, assuming that the reviews with 5 stars were written by customers who visited on a rainy Tuesday?
A: Let's think step by step. Total stars for the 5-star rating is 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 stars.
Total stars for the 4-star rating is 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 stars.
Total stars for the 3-star rating is 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 stars.
Total stars for the 2-star rating is 1 x 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 stars.
Total stars received is 30 + 28 + 12 + 2 = <<30+28+12+2=72>>72.
Average rating is 72 / 18 = <<72/18=4>>4 stars.
The day of week and weather conditions during reviews don't change the average, so they are ignored.
