If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in {z} seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?",
  "answer": "Let G be the time Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee runs it {z} seconds and is {x} seconds faster than Gerald, we have G = {z} - {x}.\nGerald's new speed improvement is {y}%, so his improvement is I = (G * ({y}/100)).\nThus, his new time R = G - I = G - (G * ({y}/100)) = G * (1 - ({y}/100)).\nSubstituting G gives us R = ({z} - {x}) * (1 - ({y}/100)).\nNow, we can calculate R with the assigned values.\n#### {R}"
