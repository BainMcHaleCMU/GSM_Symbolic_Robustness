You are given a math problem involving numerical values. Your task is to transform this problem into a template by replacing all numbers with variables and providing constraints for these variables. Follow these steps:
1.	Identify all numerical values in the question and replace them with placeholders such as {a}, {b}, {c}, etc.
2.	Define constraints for these placeholders to ensure the problem remains valid.
3.	Rewrite the question using the placeholders.
4.	Provide a template for the solution, replacing specific calculations with variable expressions.

Example Question:
{"question": "{place1} has twice as many sheep as {place2}. {place2} has 4 times as many sheep as {place3}. How many sheep do {place1}, {place2}, and {place3} have together if {place3} has 20 sheep?", "answer": "If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep\nTogether, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep\n#### 260"}

Example Output:
{
  "constraints": [
    "a > 0",
    "x > 0",
    "y > 0",
    "b == y * a",
    "c == x * b",
    "d == a + b + c"
  ],
  "question": "{place1} has {x} times as many sheep as {place2}. {place2} has {y} times as many sheep as {place3}. How many sheep do {place1}, {place2}, and {place3} have together if {place3} has {a} sheep?",
  "answer": "If {place3} has {a} sheep, {place2} has {x} * {y} sheep = <<{y}*{a}={b}>>{b} sheep\n{place1} has {x} times as many sheep as {place2}, which is {x} * {b} sheep = <<{x}*{b}={c}>>{c} sheep\nTogether, the three have {a} sheep + {b} sheep + {c} sheep = <<{a}+{b}+{c}={d}>>{d} sheep\n#### {d}"
}

Instructions:
•	Replace each specific number in the question with a placeholder.
•	Also replace words like "two" and "half" with placeholder values
•	Ensure that the constraints logically describe relationships between these placeholders.
•	Use consistent formatting for placeholders and constraints.
•	Output in json format
