# Overview

This repo contains code that builds on the [GSM Symbolic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229v1) paper. The paper hypothesizes that LLMs are not capable genuine logical reasoning, and demonstrates multiple simple variations that are capable of disrupting model performance without affecting the complexity of logical reasoning.

# Datasets

## GSM8K

The GSM8K dataset is pulled from [Open AI's Grade School Math Repository](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math). The files test.jsonl and train.jsonl are pulled directly from this repository.
